# clarity

This is web application for querying freely available US Government data. The data is first collected into
custom Postgres database using code in the related ic project. Once collected in the Postgres database, the
data can be queried in ways that the government's open data APIs don't provide. Data from multiple data sets
can be correlated, merged and cross-queried.

So far, only data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics is available, along with a minimum set of pre-defined 
queries.

You'll need the data from the ic project to make this work. The ic project is at https://github.com/diamondap/ic
